            The Bakers Dozen Club is SDU University's official dance club, bringing together students 
            who share a passion for movement, rhythm, and self-expression. Open to both boys and girls, 
            this vibrant community welcomes dancers of all levelsâ€”from beginners to experienced performers. 
            Our club explores various dance styles, including hip-hop, contemporary, freestyle, and traditional 
            dances. We regularly organize dance workshops, performances, and competitions to showcase our talents 
            and energize the SDU campus. Whether you want to learn new moves, improve your technique, or 
            just have fun with fellow dance enthusiasts, Bakers Dozen Club is the perfect place to express 
            yourself and feel the beat!
